--------------------------------
VOTING SYSTEM:
- Upvote/downvote mechanism for posts and comments
- Algorithm favors newer posts (early votes more impactful)
- Vote counts hidden for first few hours to prevent bias
- Score calculation: log10(ups-downs) * time_decay_factor

COMMENT THREADING:
- Nested reply structure for conversation threads
- Denormalized tree structure in database
- Collapsible thread branches
- Sort options: best, top, new, controversial, Q&A

SUBREDDIT ORGANIZATION:
- Topic-based communities with unique rules/culture
- Moderator tools and permissions system
- Community sidebars with rules and resources
- Post flairs for categorization
- User flairs for identity/credentials

USER PROFILES & KARMA:
- Profile pages showing post/comment history
- Karma system (post karma + comment karma)
- Trophy/achievement system
- Saved posts and comments
- Following other users functionality

SORTING ALGORITHMS:
- Hot: (log10(score) * sign) + (seconds/45000)
- Top: Pure score-based within timeframe
- New: Chronological ordering
- Rising: Velocity-based early detection
- Controversial: High activity with balanced votes
- Best: Machine learning-based personalization
