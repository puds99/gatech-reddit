ESTIMATED COSTS (Firebase)
=================================================================

Development (Free Tier):
- Firestore: 50K reads, 20K writes per day
- Storage: 5GB
- Hosting: 10GB bandwidth
- Auth: Unlimited (free)

Production (Estimated):
- 1,000 users: ~$25/month
- 10,000 users: ~$250/month
- 50,000 users: ~$1,500/month

Cost Optimization:
✓ Caching reduces database reads by 70%
✓ Denormalized data reduces query complexity
✓ Image optimization reduces storage costs
✓ CDN caching reduces bandwidth costs

=================================================================
SCALABILITY
=================================================================

Current Architecture Supports:
- 100 users: No issues (free tier)
- 1,000 users: Minor costs (~$25/month)
- 10,000 users: Moderate costs (~$250/month)
- 100,000 users: May need migration to custom backend

Firebase automatically handles:
✓ Database scaling (sharding)
✓ Storage scaling (CDN)
✓ Authentication (unlimited)
✓ Hosting (global CDN)
